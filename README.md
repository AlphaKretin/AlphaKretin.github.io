# AlphaKretin.github.io
A space for me to host some miscellaneous stuff. Has two sections:

The FE Fates Gayhack Calculator hosts my modification of armarui's FE Fates Inheritance Planner to work with UnnasumingVenasaur's FE Fates Expanded Same-Sex Marriage Hack. It has its own readme from when it used to be run from the desktop.

The next section is a spot for various stuff I've made regarding Pokémon.
  - The Colress Bot is an HTML form version of a Discord bot I wrote that serves data about the Pokémon games.
  - The Catch Rate calculator calculates the chances of catching a Pokémon and simulates an attempt to. 

The rest is just a spot for random stuff I make messing around in JavaScript. It currently has 6 distinct toys in it: 

  - bezier.html and all numbered variants draw Bezier curves according to user input 
  - mirrors.html bounces a ball around a grid according to mirrors placed by the user
  - words.html checks if the user has entered a word that starts with the specified string
  - hanafuda.html is undergoing development - one day it might play the game, right now it just deals Koi-Koi hands
  - ddd.html is a pre-link combo guide for using the D/D/D archetype in Yu-Gi-Oh!
  - misc.html hosts some smaller things, at the moment a random letter generator and a tool to display every combination of entries from two arrays

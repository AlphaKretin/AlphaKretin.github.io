Just a space to upload some random experimentation with JS.

Currently has a 4 distinct toys in it: 
  - bezier.html and all numbered variants draw Bezier curves according to user input 
  - mirrors.html bounces a ball around a grid according to mirrors placed by the user
  - words.html checks if the user has entered a word that starts with the specified string
  - misc.html hosts some smaller things, at the moment a random letter generator and a tool to display every combination of entries from two arrays

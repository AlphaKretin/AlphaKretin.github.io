A space for me to host some miscellaneous stuff. Has two sections:

The FE Fates Gayhack Calculator hosts my modification of armarui's FE Fates Inheritance Planner to work with UnnasumingVenasaur's FE Fates Expanded Same-Sex Marriage Hack. It has its own readme from when it used to be run from the desktop.

The next section is a spot for various stuff I've made regarding Pokémon.
  - The Colress Bot is an HTML form version of a Discord bot I wrote that serves data about the Pokémon games.
  - The Catch Rate calculator calculates the chances of catching a Pokémon and simulates an attempt to. 
  
Then there's a section for various Yu-Gi-Oh!-related things
  - The D/D/D combo guide accepts input of cards in hand and outputs the combos possible with those cards, including step-by-step and the field you end on.
  - The Link comment generator generates comments about decks doing well in Link format, taking the piss both at people asking if their terrible pet deck will be meta and people acting like decks are completely dead.
  - The ID Converter converts text entries between passcodes and card names, useful for getting the IDs of a bunch of cards for scripting or converting a YGOPro deck file to card names for sharing.

The rest is just a spot for random stuff I make messing around in JavaScript. It currently has 5 distinct toys in it: 

  - bezier.html and all numbered variants draw Bezier curves according to user input 
  - mirrors.html bounces a ball around a grid according to mirrors placed by the user
  - words.html checks if the user has entered a word that starts with the specified string
  - hanafuda.html is undergoing development - one day it might play the game, right now it just deals Koi-Koi hands
  - misc.html hosts some smaller things, at the moment a random letter generator and a tool to display every combination of entries from two arrays

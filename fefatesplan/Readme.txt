Fire Emblem Fates: Gay Inheritance Calculator
Made by AlphaKretin

Based off http://inheritance-planner.herokuapp.com/ , by Reddit user armarui at https://redd.it/47rm3g . I have his permission to rehost this here. (Really, this guy deserves the credit. All I did was mess with his work. Just don’t contact him about issues with this.)
Designed for use with (but also unaffiliated with) the Fire Emblem Fates Expanded Same-Sex Marriage Hack, from http://unassumingvenusaur.tumblr.com/
Thanks to two real-life friends of mine who I won’t doxx for advice and assistance, and SciresM on Reddit for creating the Fire Emblem If Text Simulator, which I used to fill in some kid portraits that existing ones weren’t close enough to.

Fire Emblem Fates and characters are the property of Nintendo, I do not own, whatever. Like anyone’s going to sue me over this.

Known Issues
————————————

- A bunch of images are temporarily removed while I look for a way to deal with them that doesn't involve hosting them all here.

- Corrin has more complicated scripting for their special case, which means I can’t make them gay. The workaround for this, which I do feel vaguely uncomfortable suggesting, is to change their gender in the planner - it doesn’t affect Kana’s stats.

- When you select a father as the “mother” for another child, that child’s father will overwrite the original father instead of residing in that child’s “mother” slot, and that child’s row will act unpredictably until the page is refreshed. (For example, if you select Silas as Dwyer’s “mother”, Jakob will override Silas next to Sophie. http://i.imgur.com/0Wn2gJr.png ) This means you can’t make a comprehensive inheritance plan, which is the reason I’ve renamed it to a calculator. 

- Portraits for children of two fathers have hair colours that are approximate at best, they probably won’t accurately reflect in-game appearance. 

- A bunch of Shiro portraits, as well as two Kiragi portraits, Laslow!Asugi, and Takumi!Hisame may look out of place. I had to generate and crop the portraits for them myself and I’m no image editing wizard. On the plus side, their hair colours will be more accurate.

————————————
In general, this thing's a massive kludge job. I didn't know any JavaScript or HTML or anything when I wrote it, and I'll have to be pretty bored before I go back and try to fix it properly. Feel free to fix it up if you want to, you don't need my permission (though you should probably get armarui's if you rehost it).
